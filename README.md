This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

1. Create the database in MySQL workbench using the provided code in hotel.sql
2. Insert all the sample data provided in the file, as well as the indexes, triggers, and views,
etc.
3. Navigate to /lib/db.js, are here fill in the relevant information relating to your
MySQL server connection, including username, password, port, etc.
4. In terminal or cmd, navigate to /hotel, and run npm install to install all project
dependencies.
5. Run the command npm run build to compile a production version of the
application
6. Run the command npm run start to start the application locally
7. In your browser, navigate the to the URL that the server is hosted on (usually
localhost:3000)
8. Enjoy

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
